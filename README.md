# Group H TD Game
## ECS657U - Multi-platform Game Development - 2023/24

### Using Unity Version 2023.1.0f1

#### Access the game through: 
--> https://speedyzozo.github.io/group-h-td/build/ 

Prototype Information and Controls:

Use the mouse to hover and LEFT CLICK on a tile on the playing field. This will place a tower on the board. The tower will automatically shoot at enemies within its range. 

Enemies spawn from the green point, and follow the path to get to the red point. You have 3 lives and have to survive 3 waves of gradually increasing difficulty.
You lose a life when an enemy reaches the red point. If all your lives are depleted, you lose. However, if you survive 3 waves of enemies, you win.
Your lives are displayed at the top centre of the screen, and the time before next wave is displayed in the top left corner of your screen.

You can place multiple towers down on the field (an unlimited amount for this prototype), but cannot place a tower on top of an already existing one.
You also cannot place towers on the path that the enemies follow, or on the green/red points.

We have not used any external assets, only Unity used assets.
